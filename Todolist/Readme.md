# Todolist 

This is a todolist web app, that can persist tasks you tell it to using a mongodb database.

This webapp supports all the basic features of a todolist 
<ul>
  <li>Add task to list</li>
  <li>Remove tasks from list by checking them off</li>
  <li>Create various different lists for different tasks</li>
