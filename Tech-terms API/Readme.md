# Tech-terms API

Tech-terms API is a RESTful API created by me, supporting all the necessary RESTful HTTP requests <br>
<ul>
  <li>GET</li>
  <li>POST</li>
  <li>PUT</li>
  <li>PATCH</li>
  <li>DELETE</li>
 </ul> 
This API can be used to get the description of a tech related term <br>stored in a database that i have created. 

You can also send other basic HTTP requests as provided above through this API to the server.

Currently this API serves basic web development terms and their definitions.
